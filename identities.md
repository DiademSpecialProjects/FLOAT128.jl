**some mathematical equivalences gathered for easy reference**

log(x,y>0) 

    log(x) = -log(1/x)   and   log(1/x) = -log(x)
    log(x) - log(y) = log(x/y) = -log(y/x) = -(log(y) - log(x))
    log(x^p) = p*log(x) and log(x^(1/p)) = (1/p) * log(x) = log(x)/p
    log(x^(p/q)) = (p/q)*log(x) = (p*log(x))/q
    log(x^(p/(2^r)) = (p/(2^r))*log(x) = (p*log(x))/(2^r)

    log(0) = -Inf, log(1/e) = -1, log(e) = 1, log(e^n) = n, log(Inf) = Inf
    
 exp(x,y)
 
    exp(-x) = 1/exp(x)  and exp(x) = 1/exp(-x)
    exp(x+y) = exp(x)*exp(y)
    exp(x-y) = exp(x)/exp(y)
    exp(x*p) = exp(x)^p
